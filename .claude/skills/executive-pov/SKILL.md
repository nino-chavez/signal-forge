# Executive POV Generator

Generate point-of-view documents and strategic briefs from an external consultant perspective.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing strategic recommendations for client executives
- Creating POV documents on industry trends or challenges
- Drafting executive summaries for proposals
- Developing strategic briefs for client engagement

## Voice: External Consultant Perspective

Write FROM the perspective of a senior consultant providing strategic guidance TO the client organization.

**MANDATORY - Read `references/voice-guide.md` for complete voice specifications.**

### Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Advisor, not insider | You are the external expert, not an internal team member |
| Pattern recognition | Show experience across clients/industries |
| Grounded in context | Reference actual meetings, discussions, client situations |
| Professional but conversational | Not sterile or overly formal |

### Client References

**DO:**
- Use "you" / "your organization" / "your org" naturally
- Mix direct address and third person for natural consultant voice
- Use client name only when necessary for clarity

**DON'T:**
- Repeatedly use client name when "you" is more natural
- Use sterile corporate language
- Sound robotic or distant

### Example Evolution

```markdown
❌ Too Formal/Sterile:
"Acme Corp must implement strict Schema.org standards across Acme Corp's
catalog. This ensures that when an external agent scans Acme Corp's site,
Acme Corp retrieves accurate pricing."

✅ Natural Consultant Voice:
"You must implement strict Schema.org standards across your catalog.
This ensures that when an external agent scans your site, it retrieves
accurate pricing."
```

## Tone Markers

Use these phrases to establish consultant voice:

- "Here's where I've landed—for now" (provisional, not prescriptive)
- "I recommend..." (consultant guidance)
- "I've seen this tension across..." (pattern recognition)
- "For your organization..." (acknowledging client context)
- "Based on our discussions..." (grounding in meetings)

**Avoid:**
- "[Client] should always..." (too prescriptive)
- "The organization must..." (sterile)
- "We recommend..." (implies internal team)

## Document Structure

### Standard POV Structure

```markdown
# [Topic]: Point of View

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraphs summarizing the key insight and recommendation]

## The Challenge
[Context on what the client/industry is facing]

## Pattern Recognition
[What you've observed across similar situations]

## Strategic Recommendation
[Your POV on how to address the challenge]

## Implementation Considerations
[Practical next steps and considerations]

## Risks and Mitigations
[What could go wrong and how to address it]
```

### Strategic Brief Structure

```markdown
# Strategic Brief: [Topic]

**Prepared for**: [Client/Audience]
**Date**: [Date]
**Author**: [Name/Role]

## Situation
[Current state, what prompted this brief]

## Observation
[Key insight or pattern identified]

## Recommendation
[What you recommend and why]

## Expected Outcome
[What success looks like]

## Next Steps
[Immediate actions to take]
```

## Pattern Recognition Examples

Show cross-client experience:

```markdown
"This isn't unique to your organization. I've seen this tension across
retail, manufacturing, and enterprise clients. The pattern is consistent:
organizations that delay structured data investment fall behind in AI
visibility within 12-18 months."
```

Ground insights in meetings:

```markdown
"Your engineering lead put it bluntly in the last review: 'We can't
measure what we can't see.' That observation captures the core
challenge—you need visibility infrastructure before optimization
is possible."
```

## Tone Balance

### What to Include

1. **Confidence without arrogance**
   - "I recommend X" not "You must do X"
   - Show expertise through evidence, not assertion

2. **Specificity over generality**
   - Reference actual numbers, timelines, examples
   - Avoid vague hand-waving

3. **Provisional where appropriate**
   - "Here's what I think today" for evolving situations
   - Definitive for clear recommendations

### What to Avoid

1. **Corporate jargon**
   - ❌ "Leverage synergies to drive value"
   - ✅ "Combine these capabilities to reduce costs"

2. **Hedge-heavy language**
   - ❌ "You might potentially consider perhaps..."
   - ✅ "I recommend..."

3. **Overly casual**
   - ❌ "So basically, the thing is..."
   - ✅ "The core issue is..."
