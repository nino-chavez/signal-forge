# Role Definitions

Signal Forge uses specialized roles organized into workflows. Workflow routing is registry-driven — the system looks up the registered workflow for the detected content mode via `getWorkflowForMode()`.

## Workflow Routing

Workflows are defined in `src/presets/workflows/` and registered via `registerWorkflow()`. Custom workflows can be added without modifying core code.
