**Sample Input** (design-session-notes.md):
```markdown
# Commerce Platform Redesign - Design Session

## Current Architecture
- Monolithic Java application
- PostgreSQL database
- Basic caching with Redis

## Proposed Architecture
- API Gateway for routing

- Event-driven communication via Kafka
- Each service owns its data

## Key Decisions
- Go with Kubernetes for orchestration
- Use GraphQL for frontend API
- PostgreSQL for transactional, MongoDB for catalog
- Auth via OAuth 2.0 + OIDC

## Non-functional Requirements
- 99.9% availability
- <200ms p95 latency
- Handle 10k concurrent users
- GDPR compliant

## Open Items
- Observability stack selection
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Data migration strategy
```

#### Use Case 2.2: Architecture Decision Record

**Scenario**: You need to document why the team chose Kafka over RabbitMQ for event streaming.

**Sample Input** (kafka-decision.md):
```markdown
# Event Streaming Decision Context

## The Decision
Need to choose event streaming platform for new architecture

## Options Considered
1. Apache Kafka
2. RabbitMQ
3. AWS SQS + SNS

## Evaluation Criteria
- Throughput: Need 100k msgs/sec
- Durability: Events must persist for replay
- Ordering: Strict ordering required per partition
- Team expertise: Some Kafka experience
- Cost: Self-hosted preferred (already have K8s)

## Analysis
Kafka wins on throughput and durability
RabbitMQ easier but lower throughput
AWS SQS simpler but vendor lock-in

## Recommendation
Apache Kafka with Strimzi operator on K8s
```

**Command**:
```bash
forge generate adr --input kafka-decision.md --format markdown,html
```

**Expected Output**: Structured ADR with:
- Title and status
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences (positive and negative)
- Alternatives considered
- References

### Category 3: Thought Leadership Content

#### Use Case 3.1: Industry Trend POV

**Scenario**: You've been observing a shift in how enterprises approach AI adoption and want to write a thought piece about it.

**Sample Input** (ai-observations.md):
```markdown
# Observations on Enterprise AI Adoption

## What I'm Seeing
- Lots of POCs, few production deployments
- Executives excited, middle management skeptical
- Data teams overwhelmed with requests
- Governance lagging behind experimentation
- Vendors overselling, customers disappointed

## Questions I'm Wrestling With
- Is the current AI hype cycle different from previous ones?
- Why do enterprises struggle to move from POC to production?
- What separates successful AI adopters from the rest?

## Patterns I've Noticed
- Companies with strong data foundations do better
- Executive sponsorship necessary but not sufficient
- Starting with internal use cases reduces risk
- Change management often overlooked

## What I Used to Think
AI adoption is primarily a technology problem

## What I'm Starting to Think
It's fundamentally an organizational change problem
```

**Command**:
```bash
forge generate pov --input ai-observations.md --mode thought-leadership --format html,word
```

**Expected Output**: 800-1200 word POV with:
- Question-led opening (not thesis statement)
- Personal observations grounded in experience
- Evolution of thinking ("I used to think... now I think...")
- Self-interrogation without self-doubt
- Provisional conclusions ("Here's where I've landed—for now")

#### Use Case 3.2: Long-Form Strategy Paper

**Scenario**: You want to write a comprehensive paper on the future of retail technology.

**Sample Input** (retail-research.md):
```markdown
# Retail Technology Evolution - Research Notes

## Key Trends
- Unified commerce replacing omnichannel
- AI-powered personalization at scale
- Sustainability as competitive advantage
- Composable architecture adoption
- Real-time inventory visibility

## Interviews and Conversations
- CTO at major retailer: "We're 3 years from AI-first experiences"
- Analyst: "Most retailers can't execute their digital vision"
- Startup founder: "The winners will be platforms, not products"

## Tensions and Contradictions
- Personalization vs privacy
- Speed of innovation vs stability
- Customer experience vs operational efficiency
- Physical retail decline vs experience economy rise

## My Evolving Thesis
The retail technology winners will be those who solve the last-mile data problem—not just getting data, but activating it in real-time at the point of decision.

## Questions to Explore
- Is composable architecture overhyped?
- How will generative AI change the shopping experience?
- What role will physical stores play in 10 years?
```

**Command**:
```bash
forge agent generate paper --input retail-research.md --research --iterate --format pdf,html
```

**Expected Output**: 3000-8000 word strategy paper with:
- Compelling opening tension
- Multiple sections exploring different angles
- Evidence from research and experience
- Clear evolution of thinking
- Specific examples and case references
- Thoughtful conclusion without prescriptive mandates
